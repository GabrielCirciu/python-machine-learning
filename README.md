# Machine Learning Music Recommendation
Using a basic sheet of inputs for what certain people listen to, we generate predictions of what a new user might like to listen to

# Environment:
The environment used to create this, is Jupyter, using Python coding language and the DecisionTree type learning

# Libraries:
The libraries used for this are Pandas, and Scikit-Learn

# Contents:
The project contains 3 different outcomes for our source input:
  - Firstly, it outputs an accuracy based on 80% of training data with 20% testing data
  - Secondly, it outputs a prediction of what a new user might like to listen to
  - Thirdly, it outputs a .dot graph that can be visualized in VSCode, that shows the Decision Tree
